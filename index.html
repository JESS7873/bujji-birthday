      <p><strong>My dearest Bujji,</strong><br><br>
      There are no words big enough to express how much I love you and care for you. You are not just the love of my life — you are my strength, my peace, my forever. Every moment spent with you feels like a blessing, and every dream I have begins and ends with you.<br><br>
      I long for the day I get to celebrate your birthday not just as your girl, but as your wife. I want to be the one by your side, lighting the candles, sharing the cake, holding your hand — not just this year, but every year, forevermore.<br><br>
      From this birthday and every birthday after, I want to be yours — completely, fully, until my very last breath. Through every laugh, every tear, every joy, and every storm... I want to walk beside you, as your forever.<br><br>
      I love you so much, my man. Please never leave me. I need you, I choose you, I love you endlessly.<br><br>
      <strong>From your beloved Bujju,<br>Your Wifey Jessica 💕</strong>
      </p>
